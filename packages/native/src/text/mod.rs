//! Selectable text: the shared foundation for every text GPUIX paints.
//!
//! Ported from Comet (https://github.com/zeronsh/comet), MIT.
//!
//! Every text node in GPUIX goes through [`paint::selectable_text`], so a drag
//! can start in a plain `<text>` and end inside a `<code>` block. That only
//! works because all of them register into the same per-frame registry in paint
//! order. Adding a new text-painting element means calling that helper, never
//! `div().child(string)`.
