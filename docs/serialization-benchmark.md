# applyBatch serialization benchmark

Every React commit turns into one `applyBatch(json)` call. This benchmark
measures what that costs on both sides of the FFI boundary, on the real
`ChatApp` queue rather than a synthetic one.

**Headline: the wire codec is the smallest lever.** Swapping JSON for
MessagePack buys 1.24x. Decoding straight into typed ops and sharing styles by
content bought **4.2x on parse-and-apply, 7.9x fewer allocations, and 5.3x on
tree memory**, with JSON unchanged and no change to `apply_styles`.

That work has landed. What follows is how it was measured, what was rejected,
and what is left.

## What shipped

Measured end to end on the real path, `apply_batch_to_tree`, before and after:

| | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| parse and apply | 127.1 ms | **30.1 ms** |
| heap churn | 900.5 MB | **104.0 MB** |
| allocations | 1 476 196 | **186 090** |
| retained tree | 224.5 MB | **42.6 MB** |
| bytes per element | 3116 B | **592 B** |

Four changes, in the order they landed:

1. `BatchOp::SetStyle` stopped holding a `StyleDesc` inline. A `Vec<BatchOp>` is
   as wide as its widest variant, so 221 764 ops reserved 312 MB up front.
   Measured on its own: **−205 MB churn**
2. The `serde_json::Value` tree is gone. The batch deserializes straight from
   its bytes into typed ops through a `SeqAccess` visitor, and strings borrow
   out of the input
3. `RetainedTree::elements` uses `FxHashMap`. It is probed once per ancestor hop
   in `mark_changed` and twice per child per frame in `build_virtual_list`
4. Styles are hash-consed by raw payload and shared as `Arc<StyleDesc>`, swept
   after each batch by `Arc::strong_count`

Rejected, with reasons, in [what was not done](#deliberately-not-doing).

## Running it

Two halves. The JS half writes the fixture the Rust half reads, so both measure
the same bytes.

```bash
cd examples
TURNS=10000 SAFE_MDX=1 bun run bench:serde     # writes tmp/batch-fixture.json

cd ../packages/native
cargo run --release --example bench_serde
```

`examples/bench-serialization.ts` installs a stub `NativeRenderer` that owns
`applyBatch`, so `wrapWithBatching` hands it the exact tuples production sends.
Nothing about the fixture is invented.

```
ChatApp ► reconciler ► wrapWithBatching ► CaptureRenderer.applyBatch(json)
                                                 │
                                    ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                                    ▼                         ▼
                            JS codec bench          tmp/batch-fixture.json
                                                              │
                                                              ▼
                                                packages/native/examples/bench_serde.rs
```

The Rust half installs a counting `GlobalAlloc`, so "live heap" is the real
resident cost of the tree, not a `size_of` estimate. It also asserts that the
compact tree and the current tree hold the same parents, the same child order
and the same styled elements before reporting any saving.

## The fixture

10 000 turns with safe-mdx enabled. 221 764 ops, 72 010 elements, 13.05 MB of
JSON.

| op | count | JSON bytes | share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `setStyle` | 59 320 | 6.37 MB | 49.7% |
| `createElement` | 72 010 | 2.10 MB | 16.4% |
| `appendChild` | 72 009 | 1.92 MB | 15.0% |
| `setCustomPropValue` | 6 142 | 1.73 MB | 13.5% |
| `setText` | 12 255 | 0.70 MB | 5.4% |

Two facts decide everything below.

**Styles are half the payload and there are only 90 of them.** 59 320 `setStyle`
ops carry 90 distinct style objects. The same ~1.2 KB object is serialized,
shipped and parsed hundreds of times.

**261 unique strings account for 564 987 occurrences.** 5.45 MB of string bytes
collapse to 0.01 MB once deduplicated.

## JS side: encode

| codec | encode | decode | wire bytes | vs JSON | resident while alive |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `JSON.stringify` | 23.96 ms | 18.96 ms | 13.05 MB | 1.00x | **26.1 MB** |
| JSON ► utf8 Buffer | 25.20 ms | 21.41 ms | 13.05 MB | 1.00x | 13.0 MB |
| msgpackr | 18.83 ms | 25.01 ms | 10.29 MB | 0.79x | 10.3 MB |
| msgpackr records | 16.85 ms | 11.15 ms | 6.96 MB | 0.53x | 7.0 MB |
| cbor-x | 18.05 ms | 36.38 ms | 10.30 MB | 0.79x | 10.3 MB |

`JSON.stringify` costs **two bytes of JS heap per wire byte**. JSC keeps a
string as latin1 only when every code unit fits in a byte, and the chat payload
contains box-drawing characters. Encoding into a `Buffer` costs one byte per
wire byte, and that byte lives outside the JS heap where the GC never has to
walk it.

That is the one unambiguous JS-side memory win, and it does not require
changing the codec.

## JS side: protocol

Interning is not a codec feature. It changes what JS sends.

**Protocol A** replaces a repeated style object with `["setStyleRef", id, 7]`
plus one `["defineStyle", 7, {…}]` the first time that style is seen.
**Protocol B** adds a string table for every value that repeats.

| variant | JSON bytes | vs today | msgpackr records | vs today |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| today | 13.05 MB | 1.00x | 6.96 MB | 0.53x |
| A — interned styles | 8.10 MB | 0.62x | 6.05 MB | 0.46x |
| B — A + string table | 6.78 MB | 0.52x | **4.32 MB** | **0.33x** |

Protocol A alone also halves encode time, from 23.96 ms to 15.55 ms, because
`JSON.stringify` no longer walks 59 320 style objects.

## Rust side: decode

This is where the money is. Median of 5 runs, counting allocator.

| decode path | median | vs today | heap churn | allocations |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **today** — `Vec<Value>` + clone + `from_value` | 63.7 ms | 1.00x | 206.8 MB | 1 755 376 |
| `Vec<Value>`, no clone | 56.4 ms | 1.13x | 150.9 MB | 1 294 094 |
| typed JSON ► `StyleDesc` | 71.1 ms | **0.89x** | 374.5 MB | 140 702 |
| typed JSON ► `CompactStyle` | 26.0 ms | 2.45x | 36.0 MB | 100 358 |
| typed msgpack ► `CompactStyle` | 19.6 ms | 3.24x | 42.3 MB | 100 356 |
| typed JSON ► `Box<StyleDesc>`, interned | **13.4 ms** | **4.74x** | 32.2 MB | 41 330 |
| typed JSON ► `CompactStyle`, interned | 14.8 ms | 4.30x | 32.1 MB | 41 115 |
| typed msgpack ► `CompactStyle`, interned | 10.8 ms | 5.91x | 38.4 MB | 41 113 |

**Once styles are interned, `CompactStyle` stops paying for itself.** Only 90 of
221 764 ops parse a style, so the 1392-byte struct is built 90 times and its
size no longer matters. `Box<StyleDesc>` keeps every named field, keeps
`apply_styles` untouched, and is marginally **faster**. Intern first; only
consider a compact style if a profile still points at style parsing.

### Today's path allocates the same data four times

`renderer.rs` takes `json: String`, so napi copies and UTF-8 validates the whole
payload before parsing starts. Then:

```
Rust String
   │
   ▼ serde_json::from_str            a String per key AND per value
Vec<serde_json::Value>
   │
   ▼ batch_payload -> value.clone()  a deep clone of the whole style map
serde_json::Value
   │
   ▼ serde_json::from_value          a String per StyleDesc field
StyleDesc
```

1.76 million allocations for 221 764 ops. Removing the `value.clone()` in
`batch_payload` alone is worth 1.15x and 460 000 allocations, costs nothing, and
needs no new dependency.

### A fat enum variant poisons the whole vector

The most useful negative result: going typed **without** fixing the style makes
things worse. `Op<StyleDesc>` is 1408 bytes, so a `Vec<Op<StyleDesc>>` of
221 764 ops reserves 312 MB regardless of how few ops carry a style. That path
churns 374.5 MB and is slower than the `serde_json::Value` tree it replaces.

`Op<CompactStyle>` is 104 bytes. Same code, 10x less churn.

## The data-oriented redesign

Everything in this section is a **phase two**. The recommended order above gets
5.4x on memory without any of it. Read this when 577 bytes per element is still
too much.

### `StyleDesc` is 1392 bytes for six properties

Around 80 `Option` fields, all inline, all allocated whether set or not. A real
element sets six. Three observations shrink it:

- GPUI consumes `Pixels(f32)`. Storing `f64` buys nothing
- a colour is 4 bytes once parsed, not a 24-byte `String` plus a heap block
- `display`, `position`, `alignItems` and friends are keyword enums, not text

So a style becomes a sorted list of 8-byte properties:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct StyleProp {
    key: u16,    // interned property name
    kind: u8,    // f32 | colour | keyword | bool | nested | percent | auto
    _pad: u8,
    bits: u32,   // f32 bits, or rgba8, or an id
}

struct CompactStyle { props: Box<[StyleProp]> }   // 16 B + 8 B per property
```

Parsing colours at ingest is a second win: paint stops calling `parse_color` on
every frame.

### `RetainedElement` costs 3102 bytes resident

`Option<StyleDesc>` is inline, so every element pays the full style size even
when it has none. Add a `String` element type, a `HashSet<String>` of event
names and a `HashMap<String, Value>` of custom props, and one node costs more
than a kilobyte before it holds any content. The `HashMap<u64, RetainedElement>`
that holds them rehashes 1.4 KB values as it grows.

The replacement is a fixed 44-byte record in a dense `Vec`, indexed by the id JS
already allocates as a counter. Children are a sibling list, so no node owns a
`Vec`. Everything variable-width moves to a side table that repeated values
share.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct CompactElement {
    parent: u32, first_child: u32, last_child: u32, next_sibling: u32,
    style: u32,           // index into a deduplicated style table
    content: u32, test_id: u32, custom_props: u32,
    subtree_revision: u32,
    events: u32,          // one bit per event type, was HashSet<String>
    kind: u16,            // div | text | input | …, was String
    custom_len: u16,
}
```

### Result

| tree | elements | live heap | per element | effort |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `RetainedTree` (today) | 72 010 | 223.4 MB | 3102 B | — |
| + `Box<StyleDesc>` | 72 010 | 124.6 MB | 1729 B | **one field** |
| + `Arc<StyleDesc>`, deduplicated | 72 010 | **41.6 MB** | **577 B** | one field plus an intern table |
| `CompactTree` | 72 010 | 9.2 MB | 127 B | rewrite every reader |

`size_of::<RetainedElement>()` was **1624 B** and is **248 B** with the style
behind a pointer. The `HashMap` holds the value inline, so that one field
decides the size of the whole table. The benchmark's own replica prints 240 B
because it leaves out `search_revision`.

**5.4x of the available 24.4x costs one field change.** Everything reading
`Option<&StyleDesc>` keeps working through `Deref`, so `apply_styles` and every
custom element stay untouched. The remaining 4.5x needs the dense-`Vec` rewrite.

Extrapolated to the goal of virtualizing in Rust instead of React:

| elements | today | `Arc` deduplicated | `CompactTree` |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 100 000 | 310 MB | 58 MB | 12.7 MB |
| 1 000 000 | **3.1 GB** | **577 MB** | **127 MB** |

## What codecs can and cannot do

No mainstream JS↔Rust codec deduplicates repeated string **values**.

| option | what it deduplicates | usable here |
|---|---|---|
| msgpackr `useRecords` | object **keys** per shape | yes, but keys are not the cost |
| msgpackr `bundleStrings` | nothing; groups strings for one JS `toString()` | no, Rust cannot read the extension |
| msgpackr `structuredClone` | repeated object **references** | no, React makes a fresh style object per element |
| Arrow dictionary arrays | string values, properly | columnar; a mutation stream is not a table |
| FlatBuffers `create_shared_string` | string values, properly | needs a schema and codegen for every op |

`msgpackr` with `useRecords: true` is also **not plain MessagePack**. `rmp_serde`
cannot read it; pnpm had to write a transcoder for the same reason. The 6.96 MB
row above is not a payload Rust can decode as-is.

So value deduplication has to happen in the protocol. Once styles are interned,
the codec choice is worth 1.3x and nothing else.

## Why styles are interned in Rust, not in the protocol

The obvious design is to make **JS** do it: send `["defineStyle", n, {…}]` once
and `["setStyleRef", id, n]` afterwards. It was measured and rejected.

It is not free on the JS side, which is the first surprise. To emit a reference
you must know the style's identity, and `commitUpdate` in `host-config.ts`
resends `newProps.style` on every commit. A JSX `style={{…}}` literal is a fresh
object every render, so a `WeakMap` misses on everything except hoisted
constants. That leaves a content hash, and the cheapest content hash of a JS
object is `JSON.stringify`. Measured with the interning **inside** the timed
region:

| path | JS time | wire bytes |
|---|---:|---:|
| `JSON.stringify(queue)` | 26.31 ms | 13.05 MB |
| intern, then stringify | 23.35 ms | 8.10 MB |

1.13x, not the 1.5x an earlier version of this document claimed by timing a
queue that arrived pre-interned.

The real objection is lifetime. `examples/timeline.tsx` writes
`left: clip.start * pxPerSecond` inline, so a drag produces a distinct style
every frame. A JS-owned table grows by one entry per frame and nothing releases
it, and on that same frame the protocol sends a definition **plus** a reference
where it sends one op today. It would make the interactive path slower and leaky
to make the cold mount path faster.

Interning in Rust has neither problem. `RetainedTree::intern_style` hashes the
raw payload, which is cheaper than building 80 `Option` fields, and
`sweep_styles` drops any entry whose `Arc::strong_count` is 1 after each batch.
A drag adds one entry per frame and releases it on the next.

The only thing given up is 4.95 MB of wire and 3 ms of JS.

## Deliberately not doing

| change | measured gain | why not |
|---|---|---|
| protocol interning in JS | 1.13x JS, 1.6x wire | leaks on a drag and makes the update path send two ops where it sends one. Rust interning gets the memory win without either |
| MessagePack | 13.4 ► 10.8 ms, **1.24x** | a new dependency and a new codec on both sides, for a quarter |
| `CompactStyle` | **none** once styles are interned | 80 property mappings and a rewrite of `apply_styles`, and it measured **slower** than `Box<StyleDesc>` |
| `CompactElement` dense tree | 41.6 ► 9.2 MB, 4.5x | every reader of `RetainedElement` changes, and it needs JS id recycling before its numbers mean anything |

## What is left

### Cheap, contained, unmeasured

Of the 592 bytes now left per element, none is the style:

- `element_type: String` ► a `u16` tag. Removes a heap block per element
- `events: HashSet<String>` ► a `u32` bitmask. `HashSet` is 48 B plus heap.
  Blocked on the custom-element trait signatures, which spell out `HashSet<String>`
- `HashMap<u64, RetainedElement>` ► a dense `Vec`. JS already allocates ids as a
  counter, so the hash buys nothing
- `Buffer` instead of `String` at the FFI. napi's `String` runs
  `napi_get_value_string_utf8` **twice**, once to measure and once to fill, so a
  13 MB batch is transcoded twice and allocated once more. `BufferSlice` is a
  pointer. This keeps JSON; it changes the container, not the format

### Probably the real 1M-element blocker

Neither of these is about serialization, and neither is measured:

- `RetainedTree::mark_changed` walks parent to root on every append, insert,
  style and text mutation. 72 009 `appendChild` ops at depth 10-15 is roughly a
  million map probes per mount
- `build_virtual_list` runs **every frame** and touches every child, not just
  the visible ones: two map passes plus a `child_ids.clone()`. At 72k rows that
  is ~144k probes per frame; at 1M it is ~2M probes plus ~8 MB of `Vec` clone

### Frame time

Everything measured here is **mount and memory**. At today's tree sizes a wheel
event still costs Taffy on the visible rows and is unchanged. That stops being
true at the 1M scale this work exists for, because `build_virtual_list` walks
every child per frame, so a smaller element does start to matter.

Also, at 1M elements one `applyBatch` is roughly a 180 MB JSON string held twice.
That is a separate wall, and no codec fixes it; a mount that large needs chunked
batches.

## Known gaps in the benchmark itself

Read these before quoting any phase-two number.

- **`CompactStyle` cannot deduplicate a style with a nested block.**
  `dedup_key` stores the *arena index* of a `hover` or `active`, and every
  occurrence gets a fresh index. That is why the Rust side reports 100 unique
  styles where the JS side reports 90: six shapes carry a nested object across
  sixteen ops, and `90 − 6 + 16 = 100`. `chat.tsx` barely uses `hover`; an app
  where every row has one would get **zero** style sharing from the prototype.
- `PropValue::visit_str` runs the CSS colour parser on every string value before
  it knows the property, and quantizes to 8 bits per channel, which is lossy for
  the oklch theme. The type has to come from the key, not from sniffing.
- `verify()` compares parents, child order, styled-ness and content presence. It
  does **not** compare element type, style content, text value, custom props or
  events, so a compact style that dropped half its properties would pass.
- `KEYS` is one namespace for element types, event names and style property
  names, and the compact tree does `1 << (id % 32)`, so event bits collide.
- The bench interners are thread-locals and are not reset between decode rows.
- `setCustomPropValue` payloads still decode to `serde_json::Value` everywhere.
  They are 1.73 MB of the fixture and hold its largest strings. They should stay
  a `Value`, because `build_element` reads `custom_props` every frame and
  reparsing there would be a frame-time regression, but the **clone** is gone.
- Escaped strings are rare here: exactly one of 312 198 value strings needed
  unescaping. MessagePack's guarantee that every string borrows is real and
  worth almost nothing on this payload.
